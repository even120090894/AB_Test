# Lenia Automaton in Unity using CS

## How to Execute
1. Find "SampleScene" in Scene Folder and execute.
2. Directedly draw lines on the lower Image, then it will show how Lenia Automaton acts. 

## How to modify parameters
1. The line width can modify in script "DrawOnImage" runtime on gameObject "LeniaImage". 
2. The grow_mu and grow_sigma can modify in sript "LeniaManager" runtime on gameObject "LeniaNode".
3. TargetFrameRate, Conv_r, Lenia Width can not modify runtime.
4. max_conv_r is set to 30, you can modify that in scipt, but I do not recommand that.
